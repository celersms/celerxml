# Overview

**CelerXML** is a lightweight implementation of the [Java Streaming API for XML (StAX)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxp/stax/why.html). It can be used as a drop-in replacement for other StAX processors,
without recompiling the source code of the user Java application. The main advantage of CelerXML is high performance. It was designed for maximum speed and efficiency. Another advantage is compatibility with Java 7
and later, while other StAX processors typically require at least Java 8.
